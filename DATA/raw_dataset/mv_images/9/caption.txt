Two circular eyelets are visible along the lacing region on the upper side of the object, each with a polished silver-tone finish and a small raised rim that encircles the hole; they are spaced in a vertical alignment where the laces thread through, anchoring the lace path at the midfoot area. The ends of the laces terminate in small cylindrical aglets with a smooth metallic appearance, located at the distal tips of the lace segments near the front toe area; the aglets are approximately 1 centimeter long and project slightly beyond the lace ends, providing a neat terminating cap. A flat, rectangular lace keeper appears at the base of the lacing zone where the laces cross the tongue area, serving as a subtle hardware-like reinforcement to organize the lace line along the midfoot (located just above the toe box and along the front edge of the upper). 

<Side View>
A pink rectangular heel pull tab is visible at the back of the object, measuring roughly 2 centimeters in length and about half a centimeter in width, and is securely attached to the upper heel region by two rows of stitching that anchor it to the counter area. Along the midfoot section, a sequence of small circular eyelets can be seen embedded in the upper, each with a polished metallic finish and evenly spaced to guide the lacing path; these eyelets align in a curved line following the side contour of the object and are used to pass the laces across the midfoot. The lateral heel counter area is reinforced with a curved structural piece that forms a distinct edge where the upper meets the sole, providing a hard-contrast accent rather than a decorative element, and it visually separates the heel from the midsole.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are clearly visible from this view; the underside presents only the outsole contact area without discernible metal or plastic fittings, fasteners, or attachment hardware, so there are no described hardware components to enumerate in this view.
