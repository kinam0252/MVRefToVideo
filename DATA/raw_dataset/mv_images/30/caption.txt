A glossy black cylindrical cap with a flat circular face is visible at the lower end of the object, approximately 1 cm in diameter, and it connects to a straight white applicator stem. The thin white stem extends from the cap toward the upper-right, being smooth and uniform in diameter about 2–3 mm, with a crisp transition where it meets the cap. At the distant end of the stem sits a teardrop-shaped applicator pad with a pink-tinted surface, slightly curved and flush with the tip of the stem.

<Side View>
The black cylindrical cap is held between the fingers with its flat circular face oriented toward the camera, exhibiting a glossy finish. A white stem projects horizontally from the cap toward the left, about 3–4 cm long, showing a subtle seam along the circumference where it attaches to the cap. The pink applicator pad appears at the left end of the wand as a small rounded teardrop, visible in this view and contrasted against the white stem.
