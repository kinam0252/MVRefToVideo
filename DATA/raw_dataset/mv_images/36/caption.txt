<Front View>
A slender, straight microphone boom extends from the left earcup area, terminating in a small cylindrical microphone capsule covered by a black foam windscreen. The boom is a narrow, rigid rod with a matte black finish that runs outward from the lower portion of the earcup and ends near the palm of the hand. The left earcup housing presents as a circular disc with a slightly recessed inner face, surrounded by a smooth, uninterrupted outer shell in matte black. The ear cushion surrounding each circular shell is a thick ring of black padding, appearing as a continuous, plush surface with a soft edge along the inner opening. A small, circular pivot attachment sits at the base of the left earcup where the boom connects, allowing the boom to angle toward the microphone capsule. The right earcup is visible with a matching circular shell and lip, sharing the same matte black finish and rounded outer edge. A short, flexible cable crosses the front area, running from the mic section toward the back, and is softly curved as it rests in the foreground. The outer rims of the circular housings feature a subtle, shallow groove just inside the edge, adding a tiny decorative ridge around the circumference. The top portion of the product shows a curved strip forming the primary support, with a smooth, consistent matte finish and no visible branding in the frame. Each earcup’s side face reveals a concentric circular contour that emphasizes the round shape and depth of the housing. The foam windscreens at the mic tip appear as a small, rounded cap, creating a discrete, softened silhouette at the end of the boom. A second, shorter segment of cable can be seen looping slightly toward the back, suggesting a detachable or modular connection near the earcup area. The hands cradle the device, but no additional hardware connectors or ports are clearly visible on the front-facing surfaces beyond the mic boom and the cable.

<Side View>
A circular pivot joint is visible where the earcup attaches to the curved support, appearing as a small round cap that allows rotation of the housing relative to the band. The earcup housing presents as a pronounced circular shell with a slight taper toward the back, finished in matte black and positioned so the outer rim aligns with the side edge of the headpiece. The ear cushion along the side is clearly seen as a thick, rounded ring of black padding surrounding the inner opening, with a subtle seam line along its inner circumference. The microphone boom is seen in profile as a slender, straight rod that emerges from the lower rear quadrant of the earcup and ends near the front with a cylindrical capsule and a foam windscreen. A small ball-and-socket style joint near the base of the boom connects it to the earcup, enabling tilt and angular adjustment. A thin secondary cable traces along the outer face of the curved support, running from the hinge area toward the back of the product where it disappears behind the earcup. The top edge of the headpiece shows a narrow, flat profile with a uniform matte finish, and a tiny attachment point where the pad assembly meets the arc. The overall side silhouette emphasizes the circular geometry of the earcups and the parallel alignment of the microphone boom relative to the band.

<Bottom View>
The underside of one earcup reveals a circular seam line encircling the outer shell, indicating where the shell halves join, with a matte black finish for a compact, low-profile look. A small set of recessed screw-like details or fasteners appear near the lower edge of the earcup shell, visible as tiny circular indentations along the circumference. The edge where the ear cushion meets the shell forms a narrow groove, suggesting a removable pad interface with a continuous black padding exterior. The micro-connector area or port on the bottom front of the earcup is not clearly visible, but a shallow groove suggests a possible attachment point for accessories or cables. The pivot joint at the base of the earcup is partially visible from this angle, appearing as a small rounded cap that anchors the connection to the curved support. The cable seen exiting the earcup area lies flat along the bottom surface, tracing toward the back with a slight bend, indicating a flexible, slip-resistant insulation. The outer ring and raised central disc of the earcup are both seen from below, emphasizing the circular geometry and the compact, modular construction of the hardware elements.
