<Front View>
The object shows two small rectangular silver-tone metal brackets at the top corners where the leather handles are anchored to the body, each bracket measuring roughly 2 cm wide by 0.8 cm tall with rounded edges, and the leather handle ends pass into and are secured by these brackets with visible small rivets. A silver-tone horizontal zipper runs across the very top opening; the teeth are fine and evenly spaced, and the pull is a slender rectangular tab with a small circular hole at its end, both finished in a polished silver tone.

<Side View>
A circular silver-tone D-ring sits near the top edge on the outer side, attached via a short leather tab and secured to the body, serving as a strap attachment point. The top edge of the product shows the continuation of the same silver-tone zipper from the front, visible along the side seam where the opening curves, with consistent finish and a small rectangular pull at the end.

<Bottom View>
Two circular silver-tone feet are visible on the bottom corners, providing lift and stabilization, each foot appearing as a small domed disc with a polished metal finish.
