The black cap sits at the end of the neon-green squeeze bottle lying horizontally in the foreground; it is a small cylindrical cap with a flat top and visible screw threads along the inner rim, finished in matte black. A white, slender feeding nozzle is inserted into the mouth of the upright bottle, extending downward into the neck area; the nozzle has a smooth cylindrical profile with a slightly tapered tip and a ribbed grip section near its base. A bright lime-green circular neck ring surrounds the mouth of the upright bottle, sitting just below the rim; the ring is thin, flat, and glossy with a consistent width around the circumference. A white threaded neck collar surrounds the very top of the upright bottle’s mouth, showing external threads and a slightly raised edge where the ring interfaces; the collar is compact and contrasts with the green ring. A thin white straw-like tube descends from the nozzle into the bottle, visible as a narrow rectangular strip that passes through the neck opening. The rim of the upright bottle’s mouth itself is visible as a circular edge that defines the opening for the cap and the neck assembly.

<Side View>
From the side, the black cap is visible at the far left end of the neon bottle; it remains detached and shows its flat top and rounded sides with the same cylindrical form and matte finish. The lime-green neck ring around the upright bottle’s mouth is seen as a thin circular band around the neck, displaying a glossy surface and a slight bevel along its inner edge where it meets the mouth. The white threaded collar around the neck is visible just beneath the green ring, revealing the external screw threads and a small step from the neck to the mouth; this collar looks like a short cylindrical segment with evenly spaced threads. The white feeding nozzle protrudes into the neck from above, appearing as a narrow, straight tube that angles slightly toward the bottle interior and connects to the top of the squeeze mechanism. The straw-like insert can be seen running along the inside edge of the neck, appearing as a slender white line along the side of the mouth opening.

<Bottom View>
The black cap is again seen at the left end of the neon bottle lying on its side, exposing its circular base and the short cylindrical body with its subtle curvature. The bottom face of the neon bottle shows a radial pattern of raised shapes near the end, forming a star-like texture on the end cap area where the bottle is closed or sealed at that face. A green ring around the opposite end of the bottle’s mouth is visible from this view as a thin, glossy band encircling the neck where the bottle would seal, appearing like a small collar. A white ring of threading around the bottle’s mouth is partially visible from the bottom angle, suggesting the same neck-assembly interface seen in the other views. The overall end-face of the bottle is smooth except for the decorative radial texture near the base, while the cap remains attached to the far end where it is seated on the bottle’s end.
