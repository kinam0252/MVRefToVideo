<Front View>
Two curved, narrow black ribbon-style handles are attached along the top edge of the white front-facing panel, extending upward and outward with a slight arc, each approximately 1.5 cm in width and anchored at symmetric points near the panel’s center. A thin, solid black stripe runs horizontally across the lower portion of the front panel, about 8–12 mm in height, with clean, straight edges and a flat finish. On the white box positioned to the right of the main panel, a small black rectangular latch sits centered on the front face near the lid seam, featuring a squared, flat profile in matte black. The orange box at the far right displays a small black rectangular feature along its top-front edge, presenting a low-profile, matte finish element that appears to function as a label or grip.

<Side View>
From the side, the two black ribbon handles appear as thin curved strips attached to the top edge at the outer sides of the object, maintaining their narrow width and outward curvature. The small black rectangular latch on the white box remains visible from the side as a rectangular, matte-black contour near the lid seam, indicating its placement across the front face. The orange box on the far right shows a concise black rectangular feature along its top-front edge, consistent with a subtle label/closure element in matte black.

No hardware elements are visible from the bottom view.
