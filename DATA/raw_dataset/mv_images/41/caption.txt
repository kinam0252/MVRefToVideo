<Front View>
A circular black cap ring sits at the top of the object, roughly 2 cm in diameter, featuring a matte finish and forming the base onto which the cap threads. A rectangular flip-top lid with rounded corners is hinged along the rear edge of the cap, appearing in a closed position in this view. A small rectangular lift-tab is centered on the front edge of the flip-top lid, providing a grip to open. A thin sealing gasket forms a narrow dark band around the inner rim where the cap meets the neck, visible as a subtle ring along the top opening.

<Side View>
The hinge pin is visible along the back edge of the cap, showing a small cylindrical connection that joins the flip-top lid to the cap body. The flip-top lid is partially open and angled away from the object, revealing the interior surface that interfaces with the spout area when closed. A circular neck collar surrounds the cap underneath the lid, appearing as a matte black ring with a slightly thicker outer lip for gripping and sealing. The front-edge lift-tab is seen from the side as a small rectangular protrusion on the lid, aiding operation.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are visible on the bottom surface; the base appears smooth and uninterrupted with no attachments or fittings.
