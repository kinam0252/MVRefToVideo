<Front View>
A cylindrical, polished gold-tone cap sits centered on the top portion of the object, with a flat top surface that reflects light and a seamless, smooth side profile. A narrow dark ring encircles the base of the cap, creating a visible transition between the cap and the body.

<Side View>
From the side, the cap retains a uniform cylindrical silhouette with a high-gloss gold finish, extending noticeably above the bottle’s top. The same thin dark ring around the base of the cap is visible, continuing around the circumference and marking the junction between cap and body.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are visible from this view; the bottom presents as a plain circular surface without observable attachments or embellishments.
