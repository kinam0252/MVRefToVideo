The object presents a circular LED ring embedded in the outer face of the left earcup, approximately 5 centimeters in diameter, with a bright blue glow surrounding a central dark area and a smooth, recessed edge that fits flush against the dark shell. A slender microphone boom extends from the lower front edge of the same earcup; it is a cylindrical rod about 4 to 5 millimeters in diameter, terminating in a small capsule-shaped microphone near the mouth area, and a tiny green indicator light is visible at or near the tip. The headband forms a curved arch over the top of the object, with the visible underside appearing red while the top section remains dark, and it is connected to the earcup via a red, hinge-like bracket that sits at the upper outer portion of the earcup. The ear cushion is a circular, black pad that encircles the front face of the earcup, creating a soft, rounded rim around the LED ring. A thin black cable exits from the bottom outer edge of the earcup and runs downward toward the keyboard area.

<Side View>
From the side, the left earcup shows the same circular LED ring on its outer surface, still present as a prominent circular glow. The microphone boom is seen extending forward from the lower front edge of the earcup, appearing as a slim, cylindrical arm of roughly 4 centimeters in length, with the mic capsule near the tip. A small red connector area or bracket is visible at the point where the earcup attaches to the headband, indicating the pivot joint that allows rotation. The headband forms a shallow arc over the top of the object, with a dark exterior and red underside padding that is visible along the edge, and the connection to the earcup is achieved through the red bracket/pivot on the rear side of the earcup. The cable running from the earcup continues along the side of the head, staying near the jawline as it heads toward the keyboard area.

<Bottom View>
The bottom edge of the left earcup reveals a circular underside with a seam or molding line forming the outer boundary of the ear cushion. The soft padding of the ear cushion is visible from below as a circular, dark surface. A discreet port or slot for the cable is present near the bottom edge of the earcup, indicating the cable’s entry point to the interior channel. The pivot joint area where the earcup attaches to the headband is detectable as a small rectangular feature on the lower side of the earcup, suggesting the mounting mechanism that allows tilting.
