A circular, matte-black ear cup on the right side features a small white oval badge with black text affixed to its outer surface, which sits flush against the cup’s skin-colored edge and is clearly visible from the front. A second circular ear cup on the left mirrors the same matte-black finish and size, connected to a slim, curved headband that arcs over the top of the object. A large round microphone pop filter with a thin black ring is centered between the microphone and the face, its circular shape surrounding a fine mesh screen that sits just behind the ring’s edge. The microphone itself is a smooth, cylindrical body in matte black, roughly 5–6 centimeters tall, with a circular grille at the top that shows a knurled or perforated metal pattern beneath its surface. Encasing the microphone is a black shock mount composed of multiple slender crossbars and elastic cords forming a cradle around the cylindrical body, all of which attach to a black gooseneck arm that curves forward from a desk clamp. The gooseneck consists of two or more segmented cylindrical sections joined by pivot points, allowing the mic to tilt toward the user. A separate rigid black desk clamp anchors the gooseneck to the table, featuring a rounded grip area and a tightening screw that secures the arm in place. A black, slender cable runs from the left ear cup down across the chest, clearly visible against the shirt, indicating an audio connection inherent to the object. The headband itself is a narrow, matte-black strip that arches over the top of the head, with small black brackets at each ear cup where the cups rotate or hinge for fit.

<Side View>
From the side, the right ear cup appears as a large circular disk with a matte-black surface; the white oval badge is visible on the outer face, located toward the outer edge near the center and flush with the cup’s surface. A short rectangular yoke connects the ear cup to the curved headband, permitting angle adjustment, and the yoke’s finish matches the matte black color of the rest of the hardware. The top arc of the headband is a thin, curved band that sits above the ear cup, with a subtle seam or edge where padding or reinforcement would be, though the visible portion remains overall matte black. The microphone’s cylindrical body is seen from the side, with the circular grille occupying the upper-most portion and the smooth lower section extending downward; the shock mount forms a circular cradle around the mic and is composed of straight and curved black bands that hold the mic in place via elastic tensions. The pop filter’s ring is seen from the side as a circular dark frame in front of the mic, connected to the gooseneck or a small clamp that attaches to the front end of the arm. The gooseneck’s segmented design is evident, with two rounded joints allowing vertical and horizontal adjustment, and it attaches to the desk clamp at the base as a sturdy mounting point. A slender black cable runs from the bottom edge of the left ear cup, looping downward along the torso and vanishing out of frame, indicating an integrated connection to the object’s audio system. The side view also shows the exterior curvature of each ear cup, revealing a clean, circular form with no visible decorative screws on the outer surface.

<Bottom View>
No clearly visible hardware components are discernible from the bottom vantage; only the undersides of the ear cups and the lower portions of the gooseneck and desk clamp are partially visible, but no additional distinct hardware elements can be identified.
