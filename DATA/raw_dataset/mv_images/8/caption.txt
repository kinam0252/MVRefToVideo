A polished silver-tone metal ornament spans the vamp of the footwear, appearing as a horizontal bar with small end anchors, giving a classic horsebit silhouette that sits centered across the toe area. The ornament is bright and highly reflective, with clean, rounded edges and a low-profile height that aligns roughly with the width of the shoe’s vamp. On the garment visible in the foreground, two circular gold-tone buttons are seen along the front placket; each button is approximately 2 cm in diameter and has a smooth, glossy surface with a subtle crest-style engraving at the center. A second pair of gold-tone buttons is visible lower on the same garment, each about 1.8–2 cm in diameter, with the same polished finish and small central detailing, attached by short shanks that connect to the fabric. At the edge where the strap attaches to the bag, a gold-tone rectangular ring is seen serving as a connection point for the shoulder strap; the ring’s corners are crisp and its surface is bright and polished. The strap itself passes through the ring and is secured by a secondary gold-tone fastener near the top, providing a secure connection with a smooth, uninterrupted finish.

<Side View>
From the side, the footwear’s vamp ornament remains visible as a slender, horizontal metallic element across the upper, showing as a continuous polished bar with small anchor-like ends that attach into the shoe leather, providing a distinct reflective highlight along the midfoot. The handbag’s hardware is visible on the strap: a gold-tone rectangular buckle that allows length adjustment sits along the strap near the shoulder, with a crisp, squared-off profile and polished surface. The attachment point where the strap connects to the bag body is revealed as a gold-tone circular or oval ring and a small swiveling clasp, both finished in polished gold-tone, coordinating with the front-facing hardware. On the garment’s front edge, two gold-tone buttons appear in a vertical alignment down the placket; each button remains circular with a smooth surface and subtle center detailing, reinforcing the double-breasted hardware motif seen from the side as well. The pocket flaps, when visible from the side, feature similarly sized gold-tone button embellishments that anchor the flaps to the garment with short posts.

No hardware elements are clearly visible on the bottom view of the object; the visible portions show the sole and heel areas only, with no discernible metal fittings or attachments in the frame.
