The crown cap on the object is a circular, metal piece with a slightly domed top and a crimped, ridged edge that grips the lip of the neck; it is finished in a gold-tone metallic color and sits directly at the top center of the neck. To the left in the foreground, a wine-glass accessory is visible with a slender, cylindrical stem connecting a rounded bowl to a flat, circular base; the stem appears smooth and transparent, and the bowl is curved outward with a classic goblet silhouette. On the right wrist, a circular watch face is visible, about four centimeters in diameter, with a dark casing and a dark strap; the strap appears to be made of a matte material and is secured with a metal buckle that lies along the side of the wrist. Above and behind these foreground elements, string lights stretch along the top edge, consisting of small round bulbs spaced along a thin dark wire, emitting warm yellowish glows.

The topmost hardware on the object is again the circular crown cap with its ridged, crimped edge gripping the neck, seen from the side as a dark, slightly domed ring around the mouth. The neck itself forms a narrow cylindrical transition from cap to body, with a smooth, amber-tinted glass surface that subtly reflects the sunset; the cap’s crimped edge remains visible along the side as a continuous ring. A wine-glass stem is seen from the side, with a slender, straight cylinder rising from the base of the bowl to a small circular foot on the table, presenting as a delicate, clear hardware element. On the wearer’s wrist to the right, the circular watch face is again visible, with a dark bezel and a wide strap that wraps around the wrist and fastens with a visible buckle on the underside. In the background, a second bottle on the long table appears with its own cap (though small and blurred) and a short neck visible above a cluster of other glasses, providing additional hardware hints of caps and bottle necks.

<Bottom View>
From the bottom perspective, the object’s base is a circular footprint, the glass base appearing flat and smooth with a shallow, circular underside; the bottom edge forms a continuous ring around the base, and the amber tint of the glass remains visible even at the lowest point. The wine-glass resting on the table shows its own circular base as a small disc connected to a slender stem; the underside of the base presents a flat surface with a slight reflection from the ambient light. No other clearly visible hardware elements are discernible from the bottom view beyond these bases and their immediate contact points with the surfaces, as the surrounding foreground hardware is not oriented toward the camera in this view.
