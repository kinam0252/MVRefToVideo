<Front View>
A rectangular, blocky cap in a highly polished silver finish sits squarely on top of the object, with flat top faces and sharp edges, projecting slightly beyond the bottle’s width. Directly beneath the cap, a slim, metallic collar forms a bright, reflective ring around the neck, appearing as a distinct transition piece with a comparable silver finish. On the front face of the glass body, a small white rectangular label is affixed and centered, featuring black text, serving as an auxiliary decorative element rather than structural hardware.

<Side View>
From the side, the cap remains a rectangular block with clean, beveled edges and a mirror-like silver surface, visible along the side faces. Just under the cap, the neck collar appears as a thin, circular metallic band wrapping around the neck, sharing the same polished silver finish and providing a subtle visual separation between cap and body. The front-facing label’s edge is seen as a narrow white line along the side of the bottle, indicating its rectangular shape and centered position on the front.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are visible from the bottom view; the base is a flat, clear glass surface without protruding metallic or structural components.
