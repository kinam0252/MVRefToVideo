<Front View>
A row of small circular eyelets, approximately 0.5 to 0.6 cm in diameter, is visible along the lace opening on the front of the object; they are finished in polished silver-tone metal and serve to anchor the neon-green laces that pass through them. At the ends of the laces are rectangular, glossy plastic aglets, about 0.6 cm long, colored to match the laces and terminating the lace tips.

<Side View>
From the side, the circular eyelets along the lace line remain visible as small metallic rings set into the upper panel; they appear in the same silver-tone finish as seen from the front and sit at the top edge where the lace line runs. No additional hardware elements such as pull tabs, rivets, or attachments are clearly visible on this view; the side mainly shows the lacing area and the silhouette of the sole without extra metal components.

<Bottom View>
The bottom-facing view shows no screws, rivets, or detachable hardware; there are no visible fasteners or metal attachments on the underside. The visible perimeter of the outsole displays an illuminated/bright edge along the sole, contributing to the neon aesthetic but not representing hardware components attached to the object itself.
