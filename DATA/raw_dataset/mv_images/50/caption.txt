A burgundy foil capsule wraps around the wine bottle neck, forming a cylindrical band at the very top of the neck with a glossy finish and thin crimped edges where it folds onto the bottle. The gold-tone candelabrum in the background presents a vertical central stem and curved scroll-arms that extend outward to hold candles, with a polished, reflective finish and decorative curling details along the arms. Each arm ends in a shallow, cup-shaped candle holder with a flared rim, designed to cradle slender white taper candles, all sharing the same bright gold-tone finish. The central crystal glass sits prominently in the foreground and features a faceted bowl with a diamond-cut pattern that creates multiple angular faces along its surface. The bowl transitions into a slender stem that tapers toward a small rounded knop just above the base, and the stem attaches to a broad, flat-footed crystal foot with a slightly scalloped edge. On the right-hand side, a long, slender polished-silver utensil lies on the table; its straight handle tapers slightly toward the head, which appears as a simple blade/tines end, reflecting light with a mirror-like finish. Behind the main glass, a small stemmed glass with a rounded bowl sits on the table as another piece of glassware, featuring a short stem and a circular foot, all in clear crystal.

<Side View>
The wine bottle neck is capped by a burgundy foil capsule, appearing as a narrow cylindrical strip that hugs the neck just under the lip with a glossy surface and crisp edge crimping. The cut-crystal glass in the center reveals its faceted bowl from the side, with the diamond-like facets catching light and a slender, elongated stem connecting to a small, rounded knop before the base. The four-armed gold-tone candelabrum rises behind the glass, its curved arms visible from the side as sweeping arcs that join the central stem and culminate at candle holders, each holder hosting a white taper candle. A small stemmed glass with a rounded bowl sits behind the main glass, its own short stem and circular foot seen from the side as a compact, clear crystal piece. The long, straight silver utensil on the table near the plate extends toward the left, its handle maintaining a consistent width and tapering slightly to meet a flat, blade-like end that glints in the light.

<Bottom View>
From the bottom view, the crystal glass’s base is visible as a broad circular foot with a slightly domed center and radiating facets forming a star-like pattern at the very underside. The stem’s junction to the foot appears as a narrow stalk rising from the center of the base, continuing upward to meet the faceted bowl. The small stemmed glass’s circular foot is seen as a flat ring beneath its stem, confirming its bottom-most contact point with the table. The silver utensil’s underside shows a smooth, flat heel of the handle and a mirrored finish along the length, with the tip of the head resting near the plate’s edge. The burgundy neck capsule on the bottle remains at the top edge in the perspective of the bottom view, visible as a narrow ring around the bottle neck where the foil ends near the base of the lip.
