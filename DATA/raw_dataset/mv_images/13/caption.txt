The object features a gold-tone chain strap with medium-sized links that crosses over the chest, and this chain is anchored to the body at two small gold-tone fittings located at the top corners of the smaller crossbody element. A gold-tone rectangular closure with squared edges sits centered on the front flap of the smaller bag-like piece, presenting a polished, high-gloss finish and no visible engraving. At the left side of the visible area, a small gold-tone circular rivet or stud is present near the upper edge of the larger monogram-style segment, showing a smooth, reflective surface.

A gold-tone ring or stud near the upper edge of the larger segment remains visible, presenting as a small circular accent.
