A circular earcup is visible on the left side of the frame, featuring a dark recessed center disc surrounded by a light gray ring and a separate polished silver-tone outer rim along the circumference. A thin white fabric-covered cable exits from the bottom edge of the earcup, descending straight downward toward the wearer. A white padded crown band runs across the top of the frame, with a soft rectangular cushion visible along the top center where it contacts the head. A small dark gray hinge or yoke connects the earcup to the headband at the upper outer edge, allowing rotation and adjustment. On the outer face of the earcup, there appears to be a circular control element—a raised disk with a recessed center—set roughly mid‑face for interaction.

The right earcup is seen in profile as a circular shell with a pronounced depth; the outer edge shows a metallic-looking ring while the main face remains darker under the lighting, giving a two-tone appearance. A light gray hinge/connector attaches the earcup to the headband just above the ear, enabling swivel movement; this joint is visible as a small block-like element linking the two components. The white headband behind the earcup is shown with a visible seam and a light padding strip along its inner surface, indicating a cushioned contact area. The white cable is seen running from the bottom of the earcup, hanging down past the jawline, and traveling toward the body’s midline.

<Bottom View>
From the bottom viewpoint, the earcup shell forms a smooth, curved underside where the white cable enters near the lower edge at about the 4–5 o’clock position; the entry point is a small circular port or opening flush with the shell. The bottom edge of the earcup presents a rounded, matte surface with no visible fasteners, while the cable exit is clearly integrated into the shell’s lower perimeter. The headband’s underside shows a narrow, flat padding strip running along its length as part of the contact surface between the product and the wearer’s head.
