<Front View>
Two small circular elements, gold-tone and highly polished, sit side-by-side on the front-facing area; each is about 1 cm in diameter, with smooth curved rims, and they are arranged with a tiny gap between them to form a near-full circular motif centered along the lower portion of the visible surface.

<Side View>
From the side, the same double-circle hardware projects slightly from the surface, appearing as a single unit with two rounded lobes; the pieces retain a bright, reflective gold-tone finish and are positioned close to the lower edge, aligned along the object’s edge line.

<Bottom View>
At the bottom portion of the visible surface, the twin gold-tone circular elements are again visible, maintaining their polished finish and a small gap between the two lobes, arranged in a side-by-side configuration.
