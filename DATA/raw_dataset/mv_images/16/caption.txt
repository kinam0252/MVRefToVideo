The object features a silver-tone telescoping handle composed of two parallel rails that rise from the top edge, with a rectangular black grip at the top end to form the retractable lifting point. A horizontal zipper runs along the upper portion of the front face, featuring a small rectangular, polished-silver zipper pull with a circular opening at its end. Near the top center of the front panel, a small flat rectangular emblem plate sits flush against the surface, offering a subtle branding detail in a dark finish. At the lower corners, two circular wheels are visible, mounted on short axles and partially recessed into black wheel housings that are integrated with the base.

<Side View>
The object shows the same two parallel silver-tone rails of the telescoping handle from the side, with the rectangular black grip at the top end visible above the top edge. The wheel assembly is seen from the side as a circular wheel with a rubber tire, attached by a metal axle into a small supporting bracket at the base. No additional exterior hardware is clearly visible on this side beyond the handle rails and the wheel housing, indicating a clean side profile.

<Bottom View>
From the bottom perspective, the two wheels are again visible as circular components with a dark tire and a lighter center, attached to short metal axles that connect into wheel housings at the base corners. The wheel housings project slightly beyond the bottom edge, forming small rounded protrusions where the wheels are mounted.
