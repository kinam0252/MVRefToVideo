<Front View>
A circular, clear pink-tinted rim forms the outer edge of the lid, about 5 millimeters wide and surrounding the entire circular component where the mirror sits, and it is glued to the main body via a thin transparent joint along the perimeter. A short, curved metallic hingepiece in polished silver is visible along the upper-left quadrant of the circle, connecting the lid to the base and appearing as a small crescent-shaped extension with a rounded pivot. A small rectangular silver latch sits along the front bottom edge of the base, flush with the surface, and appears to engage with the lid to hold the unit closed when shut. Inside the lid, a circular mirror is visible, its reflective surface showing a gold-toned script logo across the center, with a smooth, glossy finish around the logo area. Resting in front of the object is a circular white powder puff with a soft, plush texture and a pale pink edge around its circumference; the puff is held near the front face and appears to be loosely pressed against the surface for application. To the left side of the base, a small rectangular transparent container with a pale pink liquid is partially visible, featuring a shiny metallic silver cap; the container is aligned vertically and held at a slight angle by the fingers, suggesting it is an accessory accessory close to the object rather than part of its core mechanism.

<Side View>
From the side, the circular rim of the lid reads as a thin, continuous edge with a faint rose-tinted hue, indicating a clear pink sleeve around the circumference; the silver hinge is seen as a shallow curved projection along the upper edge, providing the pivot point for opening the lid. The base appears slightly thicker than the lid, with the same translucent pink surface visible along the side edge, and the silver latch at the front bottom edge is visible in profile as a small rectangular block that tucks into a corresponding recess on the lid. The circular mirror inside the lid remains visible at the interior face, though seen from an angled perspective, with the gold logo still faintly perceptible along the reflective surface. The circular puff is visible in profile as a thin disk with a small thickness and the pink-edged perimeter remains noticeable from this angle as it rests against the object during use. The small rectangular bottle-like accessory near the base is seen in profile as a transparent cuboid with a reflective cap, its flat faces and clear sides catching light as it sits adjacent to the object.

<Bottom View>
The bottom edge shows a shallow, flat profile with a small rounded foot at the front, contributing to the object’s stability when placed on a surface. A tiny circular foot or cap is repeated near the opposite side, indicating multiple support points along the base’s underside. The small rectangular metallic latch mentioned from the front view is not visible from this angle, but the hinge area along the base’s side remains detectable as a subtle metal seam around the lower circumference. The base’s underside does not reveal additional branding or engraving beyond the clean, smooth finish of the case, while the adjacent accessory container’s bottom cap remains out of view from this perspective.
