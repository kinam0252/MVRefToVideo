A circular ear cup on the left side presents a black matte face with a thin brushed-silver ring running along its outer circumference, and a dense black padding band visible around the speaker opening on the inner edge. A second circular ear cup on the right mirrors the same circular shape, black matte finish, narrow metallic ring, and plush black interior padding. A curved, slender headband arches across the top, colored black and attaching to each ear cup via a small metallic hinge at the outer edge. The hinges themselves are small cylindrical pieces finished in brushed silver, located at the junction where the headband meets the ear cups, with tiny screw heads visible on the hinge plates. A stitched seam line traces the inner edge of the padding around each ear cup, delineating the soft contact surface from the hard outer housing.

<Side View>
A side-facing hinge is visible where the ear cup meets the headband, appearing as a small brushed-silver cylindrical pivot that allows rotation, with its axis running horizontally along the connection. The ear cup side face remains circular, maintaining the black outer surface and the slim silver-edged rim that follows the circumference. The headband side reveals a low-profile, continuous black band with a discrete, metallic attachment near the hinge, anchoring the ear cup to the band. The interior padding along the ear cup’s inner edge is partially visible from the side, showing a stacked layering where the soft surface meets the hard outer shell.
