A rectangular brass-tone lock plate, approximately 2 cm by 2 cm, sits centered on the lower portion of the front flap of the object, featuring a subtle recessed inner outline and small screw heads at its corners. 
Two curved leather handle brackets with polished gold-tone metal bases are mounted on either side of the central handle, each base about 1.5 cm wide and secured to the body with small round rivets at the bracket corners. 
Two gold-tone top-edge clasps, positioned symmetrically near the outer corners along the top edge, have a rounded rectangular form roughly 1 cm tall by 1.5 cm wide and are mounted with small pivot points to secure the lid. 
A pair of small round gold-tone rivets are visible at the base of each handle bracket, securing the brackets to the top edge. 
The curved top handle itself is a brown leather arc that sits over the upper center, connected to the body by the two gold-tone bracket pieces described above.

<Side View>
Hinge assemblies along the upper edge appear as elongated brass-tone rectangular plates with rounded ends, about 2.5 cm long, attached to the sides of the product with small rivets to connect the lid to the body. 
Small brass-tone strap/shoulder strap anchor loops are visible near the top edge on the side, consisting of compact rectangular attachments that serve as means to attach a detachable strap. 
Gold-tone corner reinforcement pieces are seen along the side bottom edge, shaped as small curved caps that protect the corners and are affixed with rivets. 
At the top edge near the hinge, additional small round brass-tone rivets are visible, securing the hinge plates to the body and lid. 
The side of the handle base is visible as part of the mounting hardware, with a compact brass-tone bracket extending from the body to support the leather handle.

<Bottom View>
Two circular brass-tone feet are visible at the front corners of the bottom surface, each about 6–7 mm in diameter and attached with small rivets to elevate the object slightly. 
Small brass-tone corner protection caps are present at the bottom-front edges, shaped as little squared/rounded blocks that reinforce the corners and are riveted to the base. 
A contiguous line of tiny brass-tone rivets traces the bottom edge where the leather trim is secured, indicating attachment points for the hardware along the base.
