A series of small circular eyelets is visible along the midfoot lace panel; each eyelet is approximately 5 mm in diameter, matte black in color, and appears as reinforced rings embedded in the upper to guide the laces.

A black rectangular pull tab is visible at the rear edge of the collar; it is elongated with rounded ends, about 3 cm long and 0.6 cm wide, and is attached to the upper edge by stitching on both sides, presenting a matte finish.
Along the same lateral area, circular eyelets appear as small black rings integrated into the lace panel; these are roughly 5 mm in diameter with a flat, matte finish, positioned in a vertical sequence to receive the laces.
