The lipstick is shown as a cylindrical black tube with a glossy finish; the bullet itself is exposed at the top and has a pointed red tip, approximately 1.2–1.4 cm visible above the lip of the tube. The cap is a separate cylindrical piece, same black finish as the tube, positioned in the other hand and aligned along the tube’s length so the two pieces would slide together to enclose the lipstick; the cap’s top edge is rounded and its diameter is just slightly smaller than the tube’s body to allow a snug fit. Along the visible edge of the ornate frame surrounding the mirror, a raised decorative motif runs in a curved, scroll-like pattern at the top-left area; this ornament appears as a white-painted relief with subtle depth, extending about 4–6 cm along the frame’s inner curve and providing a glossy, high-contrast decorative accent against the frame.

<Side View>
From the side, the lipstick tube presents as a slim, rectangular silhouette with rounded ends when viewed edge-on; the body is black with a smooth, polished surface, and there is a clearly defined seam where the cap would slide onto the base, indicating the two pieces connect by a standard friction-fit cap-to-tube design. The frame’s edge is visible along the side as a narrow, curved profile with a raised beaded or fluted detailing immediately inside the outer edge, contributing a subtle textured line along the perimeter of the mirror.

<Bottom View>
At the bottom edge of the object, a small circular fastener or rivet is visible where the frame meets the stand area; this element appears as a tiny silver-toned circle embedded flush with the surface, serving as a connector or hinge point between the frame and its support. The overall bottom perimeter shows the continuation of the ornate frame profile, but the most distinct hardware element in this view is the small round fastener described above.
