Two circular gold-tone rings, approximately 1.8 cm in diameter, are mounted at the top edge on the left and right sides of the object, forming the anchor points for the two black leather handles. Each ring is connected to the body through a short black leather tab that loops through the ring and is secured to the body by stitching. Directly beneath each ring, small gold-tone rivets are visible on the face of the body, securing the leather tabs with a polished, domed finish.

<Side View>
A single circular gold-tone ring, about 1.8 cm in diameter, sits at the top corner of the side panel and is attached via a black leather loop anchored to the side, providing a secondary attachment point for the handle. The ring is connected to the leather loop, which appears to be a folded piece of black leather stitched to the side panel to hold the attachment in place.
