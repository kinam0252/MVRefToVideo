<Front View>
A white circular frame forms the display’s outer boundary, and along its circumference are white rectangular mounting blocks that are evenly spaced and appear to be fixed directly to the ring. Each mounting block extends slightly upward and holds a nail-polish bottle by its base, acting as a dedicated support for the item. The nail-polish bottles themselves display square-ish glass bodies with a colored liquid visible inside, and they are topped with glossy black cylindrical caps that sit centered on the bottle necks. The black caps have a smooth, polished finish and are vertically oriented, creating a strong contrast against the light mounting blocks and the pale background. The overall arrangement shows the bottles attached to the ring in a radial pattern, with each bottle’s cap projecting outward from the center of the display.

<Side View>
From the side, the white mounting blocks project a short distance from the circular ring, appearing as small upright rectangular protrusions that connect to the ring and hold the bottle bodies above the surface. The bottle tops remain visible as black cylindrical caps, which appear as slender, rounded rectangles due to perspective, and they sit flush atop the bottle necks. The nail-polish bottles’ color-filled glass bodies are seen behind the caps, giving a glimpse of the varied tint through the side of each bottle. The overall side view emphasizes the connection point where each bottle attaches to its white mounting block, with the ring forming a slim continuous edge behind the elements.

<Bottom View>
No additional hardware elements are clearly visible from the bottom view; the underside presents the returning edges of the white mounting blocks around the circle, appearing as small rectangular shapes with minimal detail. The interior of the display remains largely unobstructed in this view, with only the lower portions of the mounts and the ring’s edge observable.
