A matte-black D-shaped ring is anchored at the upper right corner of the front panel by a short black fabric tab, serving as a strap attachment point for the main harness. A single matte-black rectangular buckle sits on a vertical front-center strap, about 2 cm tall, and is fastened to the strap with a stitched loop; the buckle includes a small prong that engages the strap. Two gunmetal-gray zipper pulls lie along the top edge of the lower front pocket; each pull is a small oblong rectangle with rounded ends and a circular hole for gripping. A small matte-black rivet is visible at the base of the vertical strap, about 0.5 cm in diameter. A slim matte-black loop keeper sits beside the buckle, functioning to secure the strap tail.

A side compression strap crosses the side mid-height and features a matte-black rectangular buckle, approximately 2 cm wide and 1.2 cm tall, attached by two short fabric tabs. Near the top edge on the side, a circular matte-black D-ring is mounted via a black fabric loop, with the ring about 1.5 cm in diameter. The main shoulder strap area shows a black plastic slider on the strap for length adjustment; the slider is a small rectangular piece with a central slot.

Two small black plastic feet are visible at the front corners of the base; each foot is roughly 1 cm in diameter and sits flush against the bottom surface. There is no additional hardware visible along the bottom edge beyond these feet.
