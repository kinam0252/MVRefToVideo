<Front View>
A clear plastic dome lid with a circular base sits snugly atop the top opening of the object, its hemispherical shape rising above the rim and finished in a transparent glossy surface that reflects light. The lid includes a central hole for a straw, which is visible as a small circular opening at the top center of the lid, and the lid’s edge forms a precise, continuous circular seal around the top edge of the object. A pink plastic straw with a slender cylindrical form is inserted through the lid’s central hole, standing upright and centered over the top, with a smooth glossy finish and uniform color that contrasts with the clear lid; the straw’s diameter is narrow relative to the container, and its length extends well above the lid, reaching roughly a third of the object’s height above the dome.

<Side View>
From the side, the clear dome lid presents a circular rim that sits flush along the top edge of the object, with the dome’s height and curved profile clearly visible as it rises above the rim; the central straw hole is again indicated, showing where the pink straw passes through and continues upward, and the straw itself appears as a straight pink line oriented near the lid’s center but offset slightly toward the viewer’s side. The straw remains a uniform pink color with a smooth glossy finish, and it is positioned so that the lower portion passes through the lid’s hole and the upper portion protrudes well above the dome, maintaining a consistent diameter along its length; the lid attaches to the object by snapping over the top edge, creating a secure interface that is visible from the side.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are clearly visible from the bottom view; the lower surface of the object and any base features fall outside the visible area in this view, so there are no discernible attachments or components to describe.
