<Front View>
A circular disk-shaped element with a matte white finish sits on the outer side of the ear, approximately 18–20 millimeters in diameter. A slim curved support arm extends from the disk’s top/back edge and loops around to sit behind the upper portion of the ear, forming a small anchor behind the ear. The curved arm shares the same white color and matte finish as the disk and attaches to the disk at a rounded junction along the back/top edge. There are no visible logos, engravings, or openings on either piece in this view.

<Side View>
The object appears as a flat, circular housing with a thin edge, viewed in profile, with a thickness likely around 3–5 millimeters. A curved support arm is seen wrapping behind the ear, continuing from the disk, and maintaining a consistent white matte finish; its width is roughly 4–5 millimeters. The junction where the arm meets the disk is a smooth, rounded connection along the disk’s back/top edge, with no visible hinges or separations.

<Bottom View>
The underside of the circular housing presents a smooth circular surface with no visible ports, grills, or buttons. A thin outer edge seam is discernible around the circumference, suggesting a separate back cover portion. The curved support arm is not clearly visible from this angle, with only a faint hint of its attachment point behind the disk.
