A gold-tone rectangular buckle with rounded corners is mounted on the left vertical leather strap that runs from the flap toward the bottom, and its prong lies inside the strap hole to secure the strap; the buckle is roughly 1.8 cm wide by 2.2 cm tall and has a polished brass finish with a narrow central bar guiding the strap.

A second identical gold-tone rectangular buckle with rounded corners is mounted on the right vertical leather strap, mirroring the left side, and it also uses a single prong to pass through the strap’s holes; this buckle matches the left in size (about 1.8 cm by 2.2 cm) and has the same polished brass appearance.

Two circular antique-brass rings sit at the top corners where the handle attaches to the body, acting as anchor points for the leather handle via short leather tabs; each ring is approximately 1.5 cm in diameter and is secured to the body with a small brass rivet on each side.

A small silver-br tone logo plate is centered on the upper front portion of the flap, shaped as a compact horizontal plaque with etched branding, and is fastened to the leather with two tiny rivets at its ends.

Two tiny brass rivets are visible near the top edge of the front panel, one on each side above where the buckle straps emerge, serving as anchor points for the front-facing hardware.

A left-side detachable strap anchor is visible as a silver-toned ring attached to a leather tab at the bag’s left edge, with a small metal clasp passing through the ring to connect a shoulder strap; the ring is about 1.6 cm in diameter and is held by a leather tab secured with a rivet.

Along the top opening, a gold-tone zipper spans the width of the object, with a rectangular zipper slider visible toward the center; the teeth are exposed along the edge and the finish of the slider matches the warm brass tone of the other hardware.

A small, square-ish metal buckle on the inner side of the side edge is visible when partially opened; it is gold-tone with a polished finish, about 1.5 cm across, and connects a short leather tab to the top edge to assist in securing the opening.

A slim, gold-tone rectangular logo plate is seen on the interior face near the top center, with a subtle engraved brand mark; it is fastened by tiny rivets at its ends and sits flush against the leather.

A silver-toned D-shaped ring is visible toward the outer side, attached to a leather hanger via a short metal post; the ring is roughly 2 cm in diameter and is used to attach a shoulder strap.

<Bottom View>
A single small gold-tone foot is visible near the front-right corner along the bottom edge; it appears as a rounded cylindrical stud about 0.6–0.8 cm tall that secures the bottom surface to prevent wear.
