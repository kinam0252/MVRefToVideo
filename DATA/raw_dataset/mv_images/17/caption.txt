The object features two pale pink, rounded handles that form semi-circular loops, each mounted at the top edge near the far left and far right positions to permit hand grip. Each handle is anchored by a pale pink leather tab that overlaps the top edge, and the tab surfaces show two small circular silver-tone rivets securing the connection to the body. The rivets are roughly 0.5 cm in diameter, with a polished, reflective finish that contrasts with the matte pink leather of the tabs. The visible hardware thus consists of two pairings of circular rivet heads on the front-facing side of the attachment tabs, located at the inner corners of the left and right top edges.

<Side View>
Along the top edge of the side face, a single small circular silver-tone rivet is visible where the corresponding handle attachment tab meets the body, measuring approximately 0.5 cm in diameter with a polished finish. The side view also reveals a portion of the pale pink leather tab that extends from the top edge to accommodate the handle, appearing as a narrow, curved strip that abuts the body and transitions into the attachment area where the rivet resides.
