<Front View>
Two small circular gold-tone buttons are visible along the center-front placket of the object’s outer layer, each button with a polished finish and a subtle raised edge. A silver-tone chain strap with interlinked links crosses over the left shoulder and runs to the right hip, its length determined by the upper body position. The chain strap ends connect to the object’s bag at the top corners via small circular metal rings that secure the strap to the bag’s frame.

<Side View>
The front-placket buttons recur along the side seam as small circular gold-tone elements with a bright, polished finish. The chain strap is visible from the side, composed of interconnected oval and rectangular metal links that maintain a continuous silver-tone appearance. The strap attachments to the bag appear as tiny circular rings at each top corner, acting as the anchor points for the chain.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are clearly visible on the underside of the object in this view.
