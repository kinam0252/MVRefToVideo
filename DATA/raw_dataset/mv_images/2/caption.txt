A row of small circular eyelets is embedded along the front-lacing panel, appearing as tiny rings with a dark matte finish and a subtle metallic edge where they anchor the lacing hardware into the fabric. Neon-green flat laces pass through these eyelets, looping over the tongue area as they are being tightened, and the laces themselves form bright, flat segments crossing the upper surface. At the tips of the neon-green laces, short cylindrical aglets are visible, finished in a glossy translucent green and terminating the lace ends with a compact, rounded shape.

A slim, rectangular pull-tab is mounted toward the back of the upper, colored in the same neon-green as the laces, and secured by a single stitch along its base to the heel area. The lateral surface shows a continuation of small circular eyelets aligned along the lacing path, each eyelet projecting slightly from the fabric and set in a dark frame that contrasts with the surrounding material. The neon-green laces pass through these eyelets in a diagonal run toward the toe, with the metallic-looking aglets again visible at the lace ends.

The underside reveals the outer edge of the outsole with a narrow neon-green trim that runs along the perimeter, forming a bright contrast against the darker rubber. Near the toe region, small circular contact nodes or indentations are faintly visible on the outsole’s surface, indicating patterned tread elements that interact with the floor. The front toe area shows the lace ends partially resting above the bottom surface, with the aglets not in direct contact with the floor but visible at the periphery of the toe box area.
