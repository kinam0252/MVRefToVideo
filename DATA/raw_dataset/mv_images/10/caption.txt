<Front View>
A row of circular metal eyelets, polished silver-tone, is visible along the central upper area where the lacing threads; each eyelet is about 6 mm in diameter and is anchored into the upper material with a clean, beveled edge that sits flush with the surface. At the ends of the white laces, small cylindrical aglets of clear white plastic are visible, approximately 1 cm in length, crimped securely over the lace ends to prevent fraying. The eyelets are evenly spaced and align with the lace path across the forefoot, providing the metal hardware through which the laces pass.

<Side View>
Along the outer side of the object, the same circular silver-tone eyelets appear in a vertical sequence that runs toward the midfoot; each eyelet remains about 6 mm in diameter and is embedded into the upper with a smooth, rounded rim, through which the lace passes, indicating a consistent lace-up hardware design visible from the side. The lace tips retain their small clear plastic aglets at the ends, about 1 cm long, showing a crisp termination point where the laces stop and the eyelets begin or continue past them.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are visible from the bottom view; the underside presents only the sole with a textured tread pattern and lacks any metal components or rings that would be considered hardware. The visible features are limited to the rubber outsole outline and grip pattern rather than any connecting metal pieces.
