<Front View>
A circular clear plastic lid with a flat top and a thin, rounded outer rim sits atop the object, forming the top hardware element visible in this view and sealing around the top edge. A teal, cylindrical straw passes through the lid’s central sip hole and extends downward into the beverage, with a smooth glossy finish and uniform diameter. A circular logo decal on the front surface of the object, about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter, features a green-and-white emblem and is affixed flush to the surface. The lid-to-body junction creates a thin circular seam around the base of the lid where it meets the top edge of the object.

<Side View>
The lid presents as a circular outline with a visible outer rim along the top edge, indicating the seam where the hardware attaches to the object. The teal straw appears as a straight cylindrical element entering the lid through the central hole and angled slightly toward the viewer, maintaining a uniform diameter and glossy finish. The circular logo decal remains visible on the front-facing portion of the object from this angle, appearing as a green-and-white circle with consistent printing around its edge, affixed flush to the surface.

<Bottom View>
No hardware elements are visible from the bottom view; the bottom surface shows no attachments or fittings in view.
