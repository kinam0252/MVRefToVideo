<Front View>
Two circular ear cups dominate the front; each cup has a black outer shell with a white circular faceplate centered on the exterior, giving a two-tone, high-contrast appearance. The ear cups are mounted to the headband via a short curved black connector at the top outer edge of each cup, creating a hinge-like attachment that allows rotation. The headband itself is a slim, curved black band spanning across the top between the two cups, with a low-profile silhouette. A distinct seam line surrounds the white faceplate where it meets the black housing, indicating a separate inner disc embedded within the outer shell. The inner ear-cup padding is visible around the rim as a dark, cushioned edge that encircles the white faceplate.

<Side View>
From the side, the ear cup presents as a rounded, shallow cylinder with the white circular faceplate still visible on the exterior face, and the black outer shell forming the majority of the depth. The curved black connector linking the ear cup to the headband is visible along the upper outer edge, appearing as a short, narrow arm that curves toward the band. The headband itself maintains a slim, curved profile above the ear cup, continuing the continuous black band seen from the front. The seam between the white faceplate and the black housing runs along the curved side of the ear cup, marking the boundary between components. The ear cushions wrap around the inner rim of the cup and are visible from the side as a dark, soft edge.

<Bottom View>
No additional hardware components are distinctly visible from the bottom view beyond the lower rims of the ear cushions, which appear as dark, rounded edges surrounding the interior of the cups. The attachment points between the cups and the headband are not exposed in this view, indicating the bottom angle does not reveal the hinge/connector details.
